⚠️ TO WIN THIS CODE JAM ⚠️
you'll need to impress my lovely team of moderators! 😊
their marking criteria:
1. creativity
2. code clarity - can somebody other than the team members understand the code? is it nice and neat?
3. innovation - have you seen anything like this before? or was it implemented in such way?
4. functionality - does it work? 🤪
5. user experience - how convenient is your app/service for the average user?
6. design - how appealing are the aesthetics? do you like it? (personal taste kind of thing...)
7. modularity and separation of concerns - different pieces of functionality bundled in different functions, HTML in a different file than your CSS or Python, etc.
8. teamwork - did all the active team members contributed equally?
9. clear README documentation - please make sure you give us a briefing of your project along with the roles that each team member had (otherwise we can grade your teamwork at criteria 8 😉)
10. clever control flow - smart use of conditional statements and loops
11. EFFORT!!!
